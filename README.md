# USACOSucks

so this is my USACO repo with all the solutions  
~~don't ask where the other problems in section one went~~  
update (12/10/2020):  
boom i did all the problems in part 1, with good variable names too!  
update (12/19/2020):  
ok now all the official problems will be just using stdin and stdout, so yeah conventions are camelCase for java and
python, and snake_case for c++ (though there's like basically no c++ solutions lol)

## some small nitpicks

* yes ik that the convention is snake_case for python, but it was too late when i learned about that
* ther might be some debug prints left in the files, but that shouldn't affect anything
* the package names are there so vs code doesn't have a meltdown with the files lol (the thing is intellij handles them just fine)
* so i learned that asserts for input validation are somehow *bad*, but that probably won't affect anything -usaco does give perfect input anyways
