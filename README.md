# USACOSucks

so this is my USACO repo with all the solutions  
don't ask where the other problems in section one went  
i deleted the rest of them  
mostly because their code was unreadable even to me  
so i just deleted it  
and i am not doing that crap all over again  

## some small nitpicks

* also, some of them don't actually work (so if you were looking to leech off of me, too bad)- they're usually just too slow, and they're all in python. if i have time i *might* reimplement them in java, but screw that haha
* yes ik that the convention is snake_case for python, but idrc, it was too late when i learned about that  
* and yes some of the names are weird while others are normal
* there's a reader class that is in the top level, but i still include it in every single java one for simplicity (some i just use buffered reader)
