# USACOSucks
so this is my USACO repo with all the solutions  
don't ask where the other problems in section one went  
i deleted the rest of them  
mostly because their code was unreadable even to me  
so i just deleted it  
and i am not doing that crap all over again  
also, some of them don't actually work  
so if you were looking to leech off me, too bad  
the problem is always that they run too slow
