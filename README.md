# USACOSucks

so this is my USACO repo with all the solutions  
~~don't ask where the other problems in section one went~~  
update (12/10/2020):  
boom i did all of the problems in part 1, with good variable names too!  

## some small nitpicks

* also, some of them (one or two) don't actually work (so if you were looking to leech off of me, too bad)- they're usually just too slow, and they're all in python. if i have time i *might* reimplement them in java, but screw that haha
* yes ik that the convention is snake_case for python, but idrc, it was too late when i learned about that  
* and yes some of the names are weird while others are normal
* idk but there might be some debug prints left in the files, but that doesn't really matter
* the "o" in each of the official year folders stands for "official" (so it can be a valid package name)
* the package names are there so vs code doesn't have a meltdown with the files lol (the thing is intellij handles them just fine so idk)
